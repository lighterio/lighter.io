            Lighter is a lightweight Node.js framework for web applications and APIs.

            ### Isomorphic JavaScript

            When used for web applications, Lighter will render views either on the server or the
            client.  This functionality will allow Lighter to optimize for low latency.  The first
            request to your web app renders HTML and returns it to the browser, then views are
            lazy-loaded into the client so that subsequent requests only need to return JSON that
            the client can render using its cached views.

            ### Auto-routing

            Lighter is influenced by the PHP framework CodeIgniter, in that by default, controllers
            and their methods will automagically get added to the router based on their names and
            where they are found under the controllers directory. This means you don't have to
            write a ton of routing code, and you know where to find a controller method if you
            know its URL, and vice versa.

            ### Performance

            Lighter's default router is extremely simple so that it can respond faster than other
            frameworks such as Express, Restify and Meteor. The caveat is that dynamic paths are
            not supported by default, so you would need to do `/blog/article?id=1` rather than
            `/blog/article/1`. It's a small price to pay for amazing server throughput.

            ### Building APIs

            Lighter's simplicity makes it great for APIs, and we'll be adding functionality to
            auto-generate API documentation.

            ## Getting started

            To use lighter, first you must install it.

            ```bash.
            npm i lighter
            ```

            Using lighter is as simple as creating a lighter directory structure (as seen below)
            and then creating an `app.js` that requires lighter.

            ```javascript
            var lighter = require('lighter');
            ```

            Then you can run your app with Node.
            ```bash
            node app
            ```

            Soon, this setup process will be replaced with a CLI that will go something like:
            ```bash
            sudo npm i -g lighter
            lighter new myapp
            cd myapp
            node app
            ```

            ### Directory structure

            #### Assets loaded with Chug

            Lighter uses Chug to cache its static assets, and each type of asset comes from an
            assigned directory. Chug also loads models views and controllers. Changes inside
            those directories will trigger reloads of the items that have been changed.
            ```
            /
              controllers/
              models/
              public/
              scripts/
              styles/
              views/
            ```

            If you want to load assets from other directories (such as node_modules/), you can
            add to the list of locations using an API method like `addPublics`, `addScripts`,
            `addStyles` or `addViews`.

            ### Controllers

            Here's a sample controller that you could save into
            `/controllers/ContactController.js`:

            ```bash
            var Controller = require('lighter/lib/Controller');

            module.exports = Controller.extend({

              index: function GET(request, response) {
                response.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/html'});
                response.end('TODO: Show contact info and a form.');
              },

              send: function POST(request, response) {
                response.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/html'});
                response.end('TODO: Thank the user for contacting us.');
              }

            });
            ```

            To see the contact us form, you would visit `/contact`, and the form you submit
            would post to `/contact/send`. Once we have models, we can do more interesting
            things here.


            ### Models

            Models are coming soon...

            ### Views

            Views are rendered by name from `response.view`.

            The following would render a template that is stored at `/views/hello.ltl` with a
            context indicating who to say hello to.
            ```javascript
            function GET(request, response) {
              response.view('hello', {who: 'World'});
            }
            ```

            ## API

            #### lighter.addControllers(Array|string location)
            The `location` argument can be a single location or an array of locations. Lighter
            adds this location to the array of controller locations to be chugged.

            #### lighter.addPublics(Array|string location)
            The `location` argument can be a single location or an array of locations. Lighter
            adds this location to the array of public file locations to be chugged.

            #### lighter.addScripts(Array|string location)
            The `location` argument can be a single location or an array of locations. Lighter
            adds this location to the array of script file locations to be chugged.

            #### lighter.addStyles(Array|string location)
            The `location` argument can be a single location or an array of locations. Lighter

      Ormy is a Node.js Object Relational Mapping library. It currently supports
      MySQL and SQLite.


      ## Quick Start

      Get a new database connection for one of the supported adapters.
      ```js
      var db = require('ormy')(
        adapter: 'mysql',
        host: 'localhost'
        port: 3306,
        user: 'root',
        pass: 'MY_PASSWORD',
        name: 'MY_DATABASE'
      });
      ```

      Define a model.
      ```js
      var User = db.define({
        table: 'users',
        fields: {
          email: 'string',
          firstName: 'string',
          lastName: 'string'
        },
        methods: {
          hello: function () {
            return 'Hello, ' + this.firstName + '!';
          }
        }
      });

      User.create({
        email: 'ormy@lighter.io',
        firstName: 'Ormy',
        lastName: 'Team'
      }, function (err, item) {
        console.log('Created item: ', item);
      });

      User.create([{
        email: 'ormy@lighter.io',
        firstName: 'Ormy',
        lastName: 'Team'
      }, {
        email: 'ligher@lighter.io',
        firstName: 'Lighter',
        lastName: 'Team'
      }], function (err, items) {
        console.log('Created array of items: ', items);
      });

      User.get(1, function (err, item) {
        console.log('User with ID 1: ', item);
      });

      User.get({email: 'ormy@lighter.io'}, function (err, item) {
        console.log('User with Ormy Email: ', item);
      });

      User.find({lastName: "Team"}, function (err, items) {
        console.log('"Team" users: ', items);
        items.forEach(function (item) {
          item.lastName = 'Core';
          item.save();
        })
      });
      ```

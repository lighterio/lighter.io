            Jymin is "JavaScript You Minify", meaning Jymin scripts get concatenated with
            your application code and minfied within a single function closure. Functions
            your application uses will remain intact after minification, and functions you
            don't use will drop out. The end result is that browsers will download and run
            your code quickly, enabling the most responsive experiences possible.

            ## Contributing

            Jymin encourages community code contribution. Since the library is just
            getting started, please get in touch with Sam Eubank if you're interested in
            contributing.

      Shellify is a module for creating command-line interfaces.


      ### Quick Start

      Install `shellify` globally:
      ```bash
      npm install -g shellify
      ```

      Generate your CLI by running shellify from your project directory:
      ```bash
      cd YourProjectDirectory
      shellify init
      ```

      You'll get something like this:
      ```javascript
      var shellify = require('shellify');

      shellify({
        commands: {
          init: {
            note: 'Creates a new package using the Seattle Pub.js Standard',
            options: {
              name: '!Project name (can contain uppercase)',
              author: '!Author name and email|Sam Eubank<sameubank@gmail.com>',
              description: '!Package description'
            },
            alias: 'c'
          },
          space: {
            note: 'Converts tabs to 2 spaces and ensures standard line endings',
            alias: 's'
          },
          version: {
            note: 'Increments the major, minor or patch version by one',
            options: {
              number: '?Major, minor or patch|patch'
            },
            alias: 'v'
          },
          publish: {
            note: 'Publishes from the current working directory',
            alias: 'p'
          }
        }
      });
      ```
